# xls2txt: converting spreadsheets to text

## Purpose

`xls2txt` and `xsl2csv` allow converting spreadsheet files to text for
compatibility with terminals and command-line utilities (e.g. diff or
less). Despite the name, they should work with both excel (xls, xlsx
or xlsb) and OpenDocument (ods) files.

The two executables provided by this package differ only in their
default configuration: `xls2txt` and `xls2csv` both return one row per
line, however `xls2txt` separates cells with a TAB character by
default while `xls2csv` uses a comma (`,`): the tab separator seems
like a better default for readability and compatibility with various
unix utilities.

## Interface

Both utilities have the same parameter and options, differing only by
their default:

* `PATH` is a mandatory path to a spreadsheet file to convert.
* `--sheet` (`-s`) is the sheet to convert. By default, the first
  sheet is converted.

  `sheet` can be either the *name* of a sheet, or its position in the
  workbook (starting at 1, though 0 will be treated as 1).
* `--record-separator` (`--rs`, `-r`) is the separator used between
  sheet rows, it defaults to a unix newline for both utilities.
* `--field-separator` (`--fs`, `f`) is the separator used between
  sheet cells, it defaults to a TAB character for `xsl2txt` and a
  COMMA for `xls2csv`.
* the converted data is written to stdout
* returns `0` if the entire conversion succeeded, `1` otherwise:

    - no input file was provided
    - the input file was not found or not recognized as a valid
      spreadsheet file
    - the provided record or field separator is invalid (it must be a
      single ascii character)
    - the specified sheet was not found
    - an error was found in one of the sheet cells
    - an problem occurred while writing data to stdout

## Recipes

### git text conversion

This allows viewing textual diffs of spreadsheet files using `git log`
or `git diff` rather than get an unhelpful "binary files differ":

1. create a `$HOME/.gitattributes` file, or set an arbitrary file as
   the attributes file (`git config --global core.attributesFile
   <filename>`)
2. in that file, associate the relevant spreadsheet extensions with
   the proper category (hunk-header):

        *.ods diff=spreadsheet
        *.xls diff=spreadsheet
        *.xlsx diff=spreadsheet
        *.xlsb diff=spreadsheet

3. set `xls2txt` (or `xls2csv`), possibly configured as you desire, as
   the diff text converter:

        git config --global diff.spreadsheet.textconv xls2txt

## Changelog

### 1.0.1

* Switch back to calamine proper as 0.16.1 guarantees sheets are
  in-order

## Thanks

* [calamine](https://github.com/tafia/calamine) makes getting data out
  of spreadsheet files a breeze
* [rust-csv](https://github.com/BurntSushi/rust-csv) is not strictly
  necessary as generating value-separated data is fairly easy (as
  opposed to consuming it), but it provides confidence that the output
  will be properly quoted / escaped when necessary
